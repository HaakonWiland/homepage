    <h1>Letter 1: Why write? </h1>
    
    <p>
      <p>Why do a man write? I am not quite sure of the answers, but throughout my 24 year in this world, I have made an observation.</p>
      <br>The first being, a huge amount of the greatest men in history where “writers”, and I say “writers” cause often these were men with other professions aswell.</p>
      <br>Leonardo da Vinci, while being one of times most infuential inventors was apperently a great writer. Benjamin Franklin well know for his discoveries within electricity, and being an influential statsman, also was prolific in writing. Marcus Aurelius, one of the greatest roman emperor in history wrote down his thoughts in the now almost mainstream book “Meditationes”. </p>
      <br>And I could go on to google search more examples, but the idea being that great men, indepented of profession, have a tendency to be good writers. I will by no stretch of the imagination compare myself with the examples above, but my belife is that by following habits of great people, one is more likely to become great oneself.</p>
      <br>Should it be the case, that my writings would never see the face of another human being than myself, is not the point of me writing. Simply the act of expressing my thoughts on paper is of	enough value to me, and if they one day should be of use of another, will only be a bonus. The reason I decided to publish my letters is to get a sense of obligation, to keep on writing. With time I hope that my writing shall become articulate, my thoughts more reflected and my dyslexia to be less obvious.</p>
