    <h1>Letter 2: The benefit of writing </h1>
    
    <p>
      <p>I want to follow up on the thought I had in my first letter, namely the reason one should be writing. Previously drawing the conclusion that there is a correlation between smart men and men who write, but why is this? </p>
      <br><p>I think Jordan Peterson formulated a good take on this:  </p>
      <br><p>“The best way to teach people critical thinking, is to teach them to write.” </p>
      <br><p>He is arguing that when you write, you are forcing yourself to express your thoughts, and a good writer can do this with accuracy. Pinpointing in the most precise matter, what you are thinking. In return, this results in you becoming a more efficient thinker. </p>
      <br><p>I feel this is so obviously true, but I just had not thought about it this way before. And Peterson also addresses that: no one is ever told in schools why they are writing. All the hundreds of assignments I have written throughout education, I have never been explained that the act of writing has its own benefit. When you are writing an essay about, let us say: what was Knut Hamsun message when he wrote the book “Hunger”. The objective is not necessarily that you shall learn or remember his message, the objective is that you shall learn HOW to analyze and interpret his message when it is delivered in the way he writes. </p>
      <br><p>Then there is that point, why is the ability of critical thinking so important? This should to some extent be obvious, but I want to address the importance of it anyway, so it does not get overlooked. A definition of critical thinking will fall along the lines of: The ability to analyze and evaluate an issue to form a judgement. In more vernacular matter, critical thinking lets you analyze things in a more accurate matter, and helps you formulate an opinion on that thing. For every human being, in every situation, I think this is an immensely valuable tool which should not be taken for granted. </p>
      <br><p>Hence why I write</p>
