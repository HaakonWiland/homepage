    <h1>Letter 3: Talking shit </h1>
    
    <p>
        <p>The other day I had thought run thought my head: How beneficial is it to “talk shit” with people.</p>
        <br> <p>When I say “talk shit” I refer to a conversation which the subject matter is limitless, vulgar, or even offensive. I have noticed that with all the closest people in my life I have a very low threshold to start a “shit-talking” conversation. And you could say: “Yes, of course it is because you know them well and feel comfortable with them”. While this may be the case, consider the possibility that they are close to me BECAUSE I talk shit with them. </p>
        <br> <p>A Conversation where we do not talk shit, to some extent, always seem to have an element of untruthfulness to them. Namely, the person speaking is hiding some part of his/her personality, and in that way connection with each other is harder. And yes, obviously some conversations are not meant to be an area for making meaningful connections, they are simply to deliver a message or resolve a problem. </p>
        <br> <p>I am of the impression that by frequently engaging in a “shit talk” with someone, makes you closer to them. In a way, you have passed a threshold together. They say something that is a little on the edge of what is allowed, and likewise you do the same. You have shown a part of yourself which is not to be shown to everyone, and that makes the person you speak with special. Your connection with them is afterwards a little strong, and future interactions may be a little more interesting if nothing else. </p>
        <br> <p>There are people in my life that I have known for years and speak with frequently, but rarely, if ever, shit-talk with. And there are people I have met only a handful of times that I have spoken shit with every time I met them. The latter is the one I have a stronger connection with. </p>
        <br> <p>The pursuit of connection with others may be assisted by shit-talking with them.  </p>
